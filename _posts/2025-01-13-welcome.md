This is my first post. You can delete this file and start writing your own posts.

## How to write posts

Create new Markdown files in the `_posts` folder. The filename must follow this format:

`YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`

For example: `2025-01-15-my-thoughts-on-something.md`

Each post needs a header like this at the top:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-01-15
---
```

Then write your content in Markdown below. That's it!
